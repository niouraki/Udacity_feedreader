# Feedreader Project
This project is created for the Udacity Nanodegree

## Getting started
This is a simple project, which tests the use of jasmine. I had to write some suites, using jasmine
that test the feedreader application. The application was already completed.

## Instructions
* Open index.html in your browser. On the bottom of the page you will see the
  tests that pass.
* Open feedreader.js, which is located in the jasmine folder. Here you can write
  more suites to test the functionality of the feedreader application.

## What does the feedreader.js included
I included four suites, per the project's instructions. Each suite tests
different aspects of the application and its functionality. The two
last suites include asynchronous tests.
